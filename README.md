# License-plate Detection by YOLO
This application is a deep-learning based license-plate detection to localize the correct location of vehicles' license-plate with a high rate of accuracy.
This project is a License-Plate Detection (LPD) application for vision-based Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These systems utilize roadway camera outputs (images/video-frames) to apply video processing techniques and extract the desired information, which is vehicles' license-plates in this special case. We have utilized YOLO v3 in this project to achive the license-plates with high accuracy and in almost realtime.
